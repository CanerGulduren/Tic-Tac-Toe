# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Rules for Tic-Tac-Toe
+ The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
+ You are X , your friend is O . Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
+ The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
+ When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## How can I win at Tic-Tac-Toe?
+ You need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.
+ Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three X s in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the enemy from getting three O s in a row.
+ After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X ? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choices which ones might let you make three X s in a row.
+ You also have to watch where the computer puts its O . That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two O s in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the enemy will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.
